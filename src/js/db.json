You can download the code for any of the games that the Linkitz team has written. See how it works, and experiment with making some changes, and see how they affect your Linkitz.",

The Linktz app then translates those pictures into another programming language that our hardware can run.  But when you create your code in Blockly, you are creating the programming logic, such as creating a sequence of actions, or deciding between two options based on some input."

		"philosophy" : [
			"Social interaction and cooperative play are the objectives behind the design and development of Linkitz. As a technology toy, this sets Linkitz apart. We aren’t a toy that you just play with alone. We’re a toy that responds to you and your friends: adding color to a game of tag by lighting up when you’re chasing someone, turning a game of Miss Mary Mack or Slide into a rave with lights that keep time to your clapping, or sensing when you’re near a friend (who is also wearing Linkitz) and lighting up to celebrate your friendship. Linkitz facilitates amazing experiences where a girls’ imagination is the only limit.", 
			"Our team has never thought of technology as just sitting down and building something for its own sake -- to us it has always been about finding ways to solve problems and make things work better. That’s the side of technology that Linkitz invites kids to explore and enjoy. It’s a toy that shows them how much there is to love about making things, and lets them share that love with their friends.", 
			"We believe that Linkitz’s combination of hardware, code, design and wearable possibilities teaches STEM through freedom of play and exploration."
