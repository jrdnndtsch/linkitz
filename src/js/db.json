				"If your Linkitz is not flashing any lights, the batteries might be discharged.

				"Some USB cables are for charging only, and are not USB data cables. If you substituted another cable, this might be causing the problem. A charge-only cable cannot transmit your program to the Linkitz. The cable that came with your Linkitz carries both charge and data.",

							"No and no. Keep your Linkitz away from water!"
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Can I track my dog/backpack with Linkitz?", 
						"answer" : [
							"You can’t track them in the sense of watching them move around in real time. With two sets of Linkitz, using the radio and an output petal (LED or speaker), you can get notified when your dog or backpack is outside a certain range, so you can run and get it."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "How many petals are needed for Linkitz to work?", 
						"answer" : [
							"The hub contains the microprocessor and has it’s own LEDs, so depending on the program you want to run, it might not need any petals."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "What is the most petals that a Linkitz can hold at the same time?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Linkitz can hold three petals."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "How long does Linkitz hold a charge?", 
						"answer" : [
							"This depends on what program you are running and how much you are using your Linkitz. If you have three petals attached and are running a program that has all the LEDs on full power all the time, the batteries might run out in just a few hours. In normal usage, the batteries should last a whole day.  Linkitz will let you know that it needs to be plugged in because the LEDs will get dimmer and dimmer and flash less frequently as the batteries use up their power."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "How do I charge my Linkitz?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Charge your Linkitz using the cable that came in the the box, or any USB-to-microUSB cable. Plug the USB petal (orange) into the hub (yellow). Plug the small end of the USB cable into the USB petal. Plug the large end into a computer or laptop. Your hub will begin to flash orange, to let you know that it is properly connected. It’s OK to have other petals plugged in when charging. They may light up during charging, too."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Is it possible to overcharge my Linkitz?", 
						"answer" : [
							"No, it's not possible to overcharge your Linkitz. You can leave it plugged in as long as you want."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "What happens if the battery drains completely?", 
						"answer" : [
							"The Linkitz hub uses two tiny rechargeable batteries. It’s not good to let rechargeable batteries drain completely. The battery will have a longer lifetime if you keep your Linkitz charged. The batteries will turn off automatically when they're out, but it's not good for the batteries to store a Linkitz that's been run completely dead."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "How do I change a petal?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Gently pull the petal straight out of the hub to detach it. Gently push a petal into any slot on the hub to attach it.  You can watch a video that shows you how to assemble and take apart Linkitz. [link to make page]"
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Can I attach multiple petal with the same function (for example, 3 speakers)?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Yes. You can attach any number of output petals. For input petal, the hub will only read data from one even if you have two or three attached."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Do the wristbands contain latex?", 
						"answer" : [
							"No, the wristbands are latex-free."

					{
						"question" : "Can I use my Linkitz without the wristband?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Sure! Some games are easier to play if you hold Linkitz in your hand. "
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Does it hurt the Linkitz to get too hot or too cold?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Linkitz are happiest at the same temperature that you are comfortable in. If Linkitz get too hot or too cold, the batteries might stop operating properly"

							"If you have already programmed before, for example, with a language like Scratch, you’ll find Blockly easy to pick up. You can download the code for any of the games that the Linkitz team has written. See how it works, and experiment with making some changes, and see how they affect your Linkitz.", 
							"Or, just jump in! Drag some blocks onto the workspace, connect them together, upload the code, and watch your Linkitz to see what happens. Not what you expected? Go back and try again!"
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "Is coding with Blockly “real” programming?", 
						"answer" : [
							"Yes! Blocky is a visual programming editor that lets you create real programs by connecting blocks. The Linktz app then translates those pictures into another programming language that our hardware can run.  But when you create your code in Blockly, you are creating the programming logic, such as creating a sequence of actions, or deciding between two options based on some input."
						]
					}, 
					{
						"question" : "I have an idea for a program. Can I send it to you?", 
						"answer" : [
							"We’d love to hear from you. You can reach us using this contact form [link to contact form]. If you are under 13 years of age, please ask your parents to contact us, instead. And be sure to let us know if we can share your idea with our other Linkitz friends on our website!"
